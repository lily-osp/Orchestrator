# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Orchestrator platform is a modular robotics control system designed to provide a flexible, scalable architecture for robotic automation. The system migrates existing robotic systems to a modern 4-layer architecture that separates hardware control from high-level logic through a Python-based Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL), MQTT communication, and Node-RED visual interface. This enables rapid prototyping, easy maintenance, and seamless integration of new hardware components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a robotics developer, I want a modular hardware abstraction layer, so that I can easily integrate new sensors and actuators without modifying existing system code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new hardware component is added THEN the system SHALL require only a new Python class inheriting from base Actuator or Sensor classes
2. WHEN a hardware component communicates via I2C, UART, SPI, or GPIO THEN the HAL SHALL encapsulate the protocol details within the component's class
3. WHEN the HAL exposes hardware functionality THEN it SHALL provide simple, standardized methods like motor.move(distance, speed) or lidar.get_scan()
4. WHEN hardware components are swapped THEN the system SHALL continue operating without changes to other layers

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want asynchronous MQTT-based communication, so that the hardware layer and control layer can operate independently and reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the control layer sends commands THEN the system SHALL publish JSON messages to topics like orchestrator/cmd/motors
2. WHEN the HAL generates telemetry data THEN it SHALL publish to topics like orchestrator/data/lidar with structured JSON payloads
3. WHEN MQTT messages are exchanged THEN the system SHALL maintain asynchronous, non-blocking communication between layers
4. WHEN the MQTT broker is running THEN it SHALL enable seamless message routing between HAL and Node-RED layers

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a robot operator, I want a visual flow editor interface, so that I can create and modify robotic sequences without writing code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating robotic sequences THEN the system SHALL provide a drag-and-drop Node-RED interface
2. WHEN building logic flows THEN the system SHALL support loops, conditions, and error handling through visual nodes
3. WHEN flows are executed THEN they SHALL publish appropriate MQTT commands to control robot behavior
4. WHEN flows receive telemetry data THEN they SHALL process and respond to sensor information in real-time

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an end user, I want a web-based dashboard, so that I can monitor and control the robot from any networked device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL provide a web interface accessible from any network device
2. WHEN using controls THEN the dashboard SHALL offer Start, Stop, and Pause buttons for mission control
3. WHEN monitoring status THEN the dashboard SHALL display current position, sensor data, and system status
4. WHEN viewing telemetry THEN the dashboard SHALL provide real-time visualization of LiDAR scans and robot state

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a robotics engineer, I want real-time safety monitoring, so that the robot can automatically respond to obstacles and hazardous conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN obstacle detection is active THEN the system SHALL continuously monitor LiDAR data for proximity threats
2. WHEN an obstacle is detected within safety thresholds THEN the system SHALL immediately publish stop commands
3. WHEN safety overrides are triggered THEN the system SHALL halt current operations and report the safety event
4. WHEN missions complete THEN the system SHALL publish status updates indicating completion reason and final state

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want modular component architecture, so that I can maintain and upgrade individual system components independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are updated THEN the system SHALL allow modification of individual layers without affecting others
2. WHEN new hardware is integrated THEN the system SHALL require changes only to the HAL layer
3. WHEN control logic is modified THEN changes SHALL be contained within the Node-RED layer
4. WHEN the system scales THEN new sensors and actuators SHALL integrate without rewriting existing code

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standardized communication protocols, so that all system components can reliably exchange data and commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN commands are sent THEN they SHALL use consistent JSON message formats with defined schemas
2. WHEN telemetry is published THEN it SHALL follow standardized topic naming conventions like orchestrator/data/{sensor_type}
3. WHEN status updates occur THEN they SHALL include structured information about mission state and system health
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be communicated through standardized error message formats
