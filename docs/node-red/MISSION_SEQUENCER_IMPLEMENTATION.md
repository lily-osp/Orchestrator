# Mission Sequencer Implementation Summary

## Overview

The Mission Sequencer Flow (CTL-05) has been successfully implemented as part of the Orchestrator platform. This complex flow enables the execution of sequences of commands from JSON array input and manages mission state throughout the execution process.

## Implementation Details

### Components Added

1. **Mission Sequencer Tab** - New Node-RED tab containing all mission sequencer flows
2. **UI Groups** - Two new dashboard groups for mission input and status display
3. **Core Flow Nodes** - 13 interconnected nodes handling mission execution logic

### Key Features

#### 1. Mission Definition and Validation
- **JSON Input Field**: Users can enter mission sequences as JSON arrays
- **Upload Button**: Validates and loads mission sequences
- **Validation Logic**: Comprehensive validation of mission structure, actions, parameters, and timeouts
- **Supported Actions**: `move_forward`, `move_backward`, `rotate_left`, `rotate_right`, `stop`, `wait`

#### 2. Mission State Management
- **State Tracking**: Manages mission states (`idle`, `loaded`, `in_progress`, `paused`, `stopped`, `completed`, `failed`)
- **Command Processing**: Handles mission control commands via MQTT (`start_mission`, `pause_mission`, `stop_mission`, `reset_mission`)
- **Context Storage**: Maintains mission data, current step, and execution state in Node-RED flow context

#### 3. Step-by-Step Execution
- **Sequential Processing**: Executes mission steps one at a time in order
- **Command Translation**: Converts mission steps into appropriate MQTT motor commands
- **Timeout Management**: Each step has configurable timeout with automatic failure handling
- **Wait Commands**: Special handling for wait/delay steps

#### 4. Real-Time Status Display
- **Mission Status**: Shows current mission ID, status, progress, and last update time
- **Progress Tracking**: Displays current step number and total steps
- **Error Reporting**: Shows validation errors and execution failures
- **MQTT Integration**: Publishes status updates to `orchestrator/status/mission` topic

#### 5. Safety Integration
- **Telemetry Monitoring**: Processes sensor data during mission execution
- **Obstacle Detection**: Automatically pauses mission if LiDAR detects obstacles
- **Emergency Stop**: Integrates with existing emergency stop system
- **Step Completion**: Uses encoder feedback to determine when movement steps are complete

## Mission JSON Format

```json
[
  {
    "action": "move_forward",
    "parameters": {
      "distance": 100,
      "speed": 0.5
    },
    "timeout": 10,
    "description": "Move forward 100cm"
  },
  {
    "action": "rotate_right",
    "parameters": {
      "angle": 90,
      "speed": 0.3
    },
    "timeout": 5,
    "description": "Turn right 90 degrees"
  },
  {
    "action": "wait",
    "parameters": {
      "duration": 2000
    },
    "timeout": 3,
    "description": "Wait 2 seconds"
  }
]
```

## MQTT Topics

### Commands (Subscribed)
- `orchestrator/cmd/mission` - Mission control commands

### Status (Published)
- `orchestrator/status/mission` - Mission execution status and progress

### Motor Commands (Published)
- `orchestrator/cmd/motors` - Individual step motor commands

### Telemetry (Subscribed)
- `orchestrator/data/+` - Sensor data for step completion and safety monitoring

## Requirements Satisfied

### Requirement 3.2 - Visual Flow Editor for Sequences
✅ **Implemented**: The mission sequencer provides a visual interface for creating and executing robotic sequences through Node-RED flows.

### Requirement 3.4 - Real-Time Telemetry Processing
✅ **Implemented**: The system processes and responds to sensor information in real-time during mission execution, including:
- Encoder data for step completion detection
- LiDAR data for safety monitoring and obstacle detection

### Requirement 6.4 - Modular Component Architecture
✅ **Implemented**: The mission sequencer is contained within the Node-RED layer and can be modified independently without affecting other system components.

### Requirement 7.3 - Standardized Communication Protocols
✅ **Implemented**: All communication uses standardized JSON message formats and follows the established MQTT topic naming conventions.

## Flow Architecture

```
Mission Input → Validation → State Manager → Step Executor → Motor Commands
     ↓              ↓            ↓              ↓              ↓
Status Display ← Status Publisher ← Mission Status ← Telemetry Monitor
```

## Key Node Functions

1. **Mission JSON Validator**: Validates mission structure and stores in flow context
2. **Mission State Manager**: Handles mission lifecycle and state transitions
3. **Step Executor**: Executes individual steps and manages step progression
4. **Mission Telemetry Processor**: Monitors sensor data for step completion and safety
5. **Mission Status Publisher**: Publishes status updates via MQTT
6. **Mission Status Display**: Shows real-time mission status in dashboard

## Integration Points

- **Existing Motor Commands**: Reuses existing motor command validation and MQTT publishing
- **Safety System**: Integrates with existing emergency stop and safety monitoring
- **Dashboard**: Adds new UI groups to existing dashboard structure
- **MQTT Broker**: Uses existing broker configuration and topic structure

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Unit Testing**: Test individual mission steps with mock telemetry data
2. **Integration Testing**: Test complete mission sequences with simulated hardware
3. **Safety Testing**: Verify obstacle detection and emergency stop integration
4. **Performance Testing**: Test mission execution timing and timeout handling

## Future Enhancements

1. **Mission Templates**: Pre-defined mission templates for common tasks
2. **Mission Recording**: Record and replay actual robot movements as missions
3. **Conditional Logic**: Support for conditional steps based on sensor readings
4. **Mission Scheduling**: Time-based mission execution scheduling
5. **Mission History**: Log and review completed mission execution history

## Files Modified

- `configs/node_red_config/flows.json` - Added 13 new mission sequencer nodes
- `configs/node_red_config/flows_backup_before_mission_sequencer_*.json` - Backup created

## Deployment Notes

The mission sequencer flows have been integrated into the main Node-RED flows.json file. When Node-RED is restarted, the new Mission Sequencer tab will be available in the flow editor, and the Mission Sequencer and Mission Status groups will appear in the dashboard.

No additional dependencies or configuration changes are required - the implementation uses existing Node-RED capabilities and MQTT infrastructure.
